# NullSec Cyber Security Academy

Every Thursday at 6pm PST, we get together on the Null:404 Discord server sharing IT, networking, and security related topics for those looking to get into the field.

This repo will list topics discussed in weekly meetups.

If you have anything you'd like to contribute, please feel free to submit a pull request. If you don't know how, feel free to ask one of the server members :)
